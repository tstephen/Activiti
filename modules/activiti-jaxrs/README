Strategy: 
 1. Make the Service classes returned by ProcessEngine implementations into 
 natively RESTful resource handlers. 
 
 - Requires creation of a JAX-RS Application class that will handle 
 initialization and return singletons of each service class. 
  
 2. Make the interfaces employed by the service lasses serializable as XML and 
 JSON through JAXB. 
 
 - Requires JavaBeans implementations of the interfaces to be created and for 
 the existing class hierarchy to have these classes inserted at the top of the 
 hierarchy.
